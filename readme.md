# Breathe Bubble

## Notes from Stéphane

Yes, this is a nice practical idea that'll let you understand many things:

* Events (creating and listening to them)
* Associate sound (thus learning what an API is and how the audio API works)
* DOM handling

Also, you'll get a chance to look into CSS animation – `keyframes` etc.

CSS animations are optimised by browsers and thus are less hacky than JS-based animations.

The `object.property`, `object.method()` is the single most important concept in JS, and this is how you'll write your own objects.

This is, also, how you talk with the DOM, and how you'll end up talking with an audio object that will handle the breathe-in, breathe-out sounds.
